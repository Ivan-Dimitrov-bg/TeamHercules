		<h2>Story</h2>
			<p>The <span class="italic">JavaScript Museum</span> was a peaceful place, where kids loved to hang in, to learn 
			the knacks of JavaScript. Until the day when <span class="italic">The Evil Pacman</span> broke in. He was greedy and wanted all the treasures in the  museum for himself. 
			He started eating through them, swallowing every last piece of JavaScript knowledge there was. The more he ate, the cleverer he got.
			</p>
			<p>What he didn’t expect though were <span class="italic">The JavaSript Guardians</span> – Nick, Don, Kenny and Paul, who swore to protect the JavaScript treasures with their lives.
			They chased after <span class="italic">The Evil Pacman</span> to keep as much of the treasures as they could. 
			But <span class="italic">Pacman</span> was sneaky and managed to avoid the <span class="italic">Guardians</span> for a while. 
			</p>
			<p>However, he didn’t know about the traps the <span class="italic">Guardians</span> had set. Every now and then he stumbled upon one.
			He had to solve a riddle in order to get out. If he answered correctly, he got extra power to keep going but if he didn’t, he was slowed down by a special slowing-down potion, stirred by one of the <span class="italic">Guardians</span> (who we shall not name), until it wore out. 
			</p>
			<p>If <span class="italic">Pacman</span> managed to eat all the treasures, a door to a new room in the museum revealed itself, leading <span class="italic">the Evil One</span> to more treasures.
			But he wasn’t always so lucky. The first two times <span class="italic">Pacman</span> was caught, he got a warning and the <span class="italic">Guardians</span> let him go. 
			But when he didn’t listen and kept eating through the treasures, the <span class="italic">Guardians</span> had had enough. When they caught him for a third time, he was banned from the <span class="italic">JavaScript Museum</span> and the <span class="italic">Guardians</span> continued with their peaceful lives, happy that the treasures were safe for the studious little kids to learn from.
